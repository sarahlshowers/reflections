## Content Updates

To create a new post, follow the setup instructions above. Open the repo in your favorite text editor and look inside the `content/` directory. The easiest way to get started is to duplicate another post and modify the metadata and content. For images, follow the same pattern as one of the other posts, placing the image file in `/static/images/image-name.jpg` and refer to it as `/images/image-name.jpg`.
