# New York City

New York City is always amazing. New York City with a group of friends traveling for another friend's wedding just elevates the experience even more. So much happened in the few days we were here, I'll try to touch on the highlights.

## The hotel

This is the second time we have stayed at the Ace Hotel in Midtown and the experience was equally as great. It's what brought us back a second time, that and it's proximity to the LinkedIn New York office (this was a working trip).

The lobby of [this hotel](http://www.acehotel.com/newyork?) is always full of people — during the day it's crammed with people working away on their MacBooks, most of them with coffee from the Stumptown Coffee shop located in the same building, by night there is a DJ and a well populated bar, open until 2am.

## The office

I have visited the LinkedIn office in New York City once before but it was before my tenure as a LinkedIn employee began. There is something to be said about going to work in the Empire State Building, I wish I'd spent more time exploring but getting around the building was hard cuz I'm a bloody idiot and lost my badge the day before we traveled.

## Sleep No more

I'm trying to decide whether or not this experience should get a post all of it's own. Yeah, this was truly something, read it [here](http://www.sarahlshowers.com/sleep-no-more-03-18/)

## The Gramercy Tavern

This was another second, back to back trips we have eaten at The Gramercy Tavern. The first time we ate in their bar area; walk ins only, all service fees included, worth every bit of it's Michelin star. This trip we made plans to eat in the dining room with a couple of friends.

When you dine at a location and leave having enjoyed such a solid experience there is always the thought at the back of your mind that the second time could well be a let down but this was 100% not the case at the [Gramercy Tavern](https://www.gramercytavern.com/menu/). The service was every bit as excellent as our first visit, the food was mind-blowing, they went out of the way to accommodate a dietary restriction, we even got to enjoy a round of cocktails at our table prior to any food being delivered, without feeling rushed — that never EVER happens.

There are two options when it comes to dining in the dining room: a three course meal with a handful of choices per course or a 7 course tasting menu. We went with the tasting [menu](https://www.gramercytavern.com/menu/) and did not regret it. The menu is fixed at $179 per head and included dishes ranging from scallops, chowders, fish, and beef. This is definitely up there with one of the most expensive meals I've every eaten in my life, but man, it was worth every. Single. Penny!

## Katz Delicatesen

You know you hear about these places and you feel like you have to go because of all of the hype. I mean this place has been in movies (When Harry Met Sally... yep _that_ scene was filmed here), it's been on the Food Network and the Travel Channel, it's one of Anthony Bourdain's top ten spots in NYC but you know what? I didn't like [Katz Deli](https://www.katzsdelicatessen.com/). I'm going against the popular opinion but I just do not like pastrami. Sorry! If you're in the area and looking for an iconic New York lunch spot and don't mind waiting in line for a bit, then it's cool to check of your list but I could easily skip it. Yeah, I could've gotten something different but pastrami on rye is what they do there sooooo...

## Bar hoppin' in Brooklyn

We were up bright and early to catch a ride on the subway to Downtown Brooklyn where we enjoyed brunch at a [German restaurant](https://www.blackforestbrooklyn.com/). I didn't know German food and brunch were things that went together but what's not to enjoy about a breaded and fried piece of pork with fried eggs served over the top?!

After food we walked down to the water and hopped around a few bars. Met up with friends, went to more bars before heading back to the city to our sushi dinner!

## Sushi by Bou

We made reservations here. Based on a recommendation from a fellow guest at the wedding we attended and am I glad we did. I feel like my standards when it comes to sushi have gotten pretty high after [the Japan trip](https://japan.theshowersfam.com/) and all of the fabulous omakase we've eaten around San Francisco but this lived up to my high expectations. First of all the place prides itself on a $50, 12 piece, 30 minute dining experience. You might think that 30 minutes would feel rushed but when you do the math that's 2.5 minutes per piece of sushi. We were done with plenty of time, enough to order multiple extra pieces of o-toro and wagyu beef! At the end of our 30 minutes, the host graciously stopped by and asked us to vacate our spots and with that we slid over to a couch and enjoyed some complimentary sake.

Not once did I feel rushed nor like my business wasn't important to them and I'd happily go back over and over again. This was absolutely up there with my favorite sushi experiences.
