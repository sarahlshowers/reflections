Pregnancy blood test today
Of course the phone rings right when I order coffee and Dunkin’ Donuts, run out the door and answer. It was Dr Brady “You’re pregnant!”, immediately started crying
Cried all the way home from Dunkin’, happiest tears ever
I get to tell Derrick he’s going to be a dad. I’ve had this book for almost 2 years to give to him on the day I find out!
What do we do about Cindy? She’s coming tomorrow, there’s no way we can lie
We need to research hospitals and drs based on our insurance.

We told Cindy and asked her to swear she wouldn’t tell anyone.
Thanksgiving dinner with lots of water and Derrick found me some non-alcoholic sparkling wine, what a doll!

Walked home from appointment. Listened to the new Take That album. Multiple songs had me sniveling, blaming the hormones
Book of Mormon!!
HGC 918, it’s supposed to be pretty good :)
First time I told somebody I’m pregnant. Going for dinner at a nice restaurant and plan to get the chefs tasting which we don’t want to end up with me eating raw fish or something else I can’t eat.

What happens if something goes wrong after all this time? I know so many people that have suffered from miscarriage: friend, friend, friend, fmaily member. I bet there’s more but these four I know first hand, not just acquaintances. The heartbreak after trying for so long and have something go wrong would kill me. Let’s not dwell on it too much. “At least you know you can get pregnant now” – that’s dumb but I’m used to people saying thoughtless things.

And family member... wow, that’s a lot of people, I’m up to 5 people that I know well!
Picked a hospital to deliver at and with that an Obstetrician.

Not telling people sucks. I want to be excited and shout it from the rooftops but then, what if something happens? It would be so hard to share something so sad on the back of something that should be such a happy time.
Made first prenatal appointment with OB - Dr S on week 8
Bloodwork results today 5494 which I’m told is excellent
