# Mother’s Day

This little person, the one that after years of trying made me a mother; She doesn’t know the tears I cried waiting for her. She doesn’t know the pain and discomfort my body went through to keep her safe until it was time for her to come into the world. She doesn’t know my body was broken after delivering her and that I’m still mentally and physically recovering almost 10 months later. She doesn’t know the tears I’ve cried when I’ve reached my limit and feel like I’m just so done.

I hope that she does know how loved she is. How precious she is. I hope that she knows joy and seeks adventure. I hope that she feels supported and unafraid to make mistakes. I hope that she will always trust that my arms will be there to hold her, any time she needs.

Thank you Sophie for being the most amazing gift anyone could give and teaching me every day how to be a better person for you.
