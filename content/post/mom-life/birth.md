BP sat AM 131/91 called on call and she asked us to come in for observation 
Arrived at hospital around 9:30
After taking BP she recommended inducing
Cervical exam, barely fingertip dilated
Anesthesiologist came by to talk risk and procedure and to sign papaer work
Cytotec at 11:30, monitors attached 
Baby elevated heart rate, started fluids. Showed no other signs of stress.
7pm dilated to 1cm, placed foley balloon
Bit of a headache, took Tylenol
8pm pitocin
10 asked for epidural
Zofran for nausea, threw up 3 times
Had to wait in a queue
11-ish got the epidural
Catheter soon after
Slept a few hours, nurse came in help me turn over, readjust monitors. Not feeling anything!

215 water broke

8pm no real change. Dr did exam and still at 4cm and baby really high. She felt a water bag and so didn’t think they had ruptured fully, they were fully broken and contraction intensified 
Going the check again in 3 hours, may need a c-section
Very quickly started getting stronger contractions so got more epidural

10:30 head is moving down, 80% effaced we’re leaning back to vaginal delivery

12:30 really painful pressure 8/10. Another epidural top off, quick exam, we’re at 5cm and baby is low. Also threw up. Think we might be in active labor.
1:00 zofran for nausea
4:30 8.5cm 100 -1 
Contractions started getting instense around 7, dr came in and she was lower and maybe we could try pushing through the next contraction
OB came in and didn’t think she was low enough and wanted to avoid 3 hours of pushing and wait until she was even lower, she also called to have my epidural halved... what?! Already dying here!!!
At shift change our fav OB came in and said rubbish let get anasthesia back, turn it up and use these contractions to have a baby. Room had Dr, two nurses, an additional resident and to students. Pushed for 90 minutes. Got to feel babies head crowning!
