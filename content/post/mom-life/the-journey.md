# 9/13 - The Journey Continues*

21 months into this adventure we are starting to find our feet post-relocation and have met our new doc. What a difference the Dr can make!

Since April we have been undergoing treatment with a very nice but slightly eccentric doctor. Since the initial consultation I thought he was a bit quirky but he was certainly nice enough; he talked through the various testing and our options moving forwards.

## Tests
### Ultrasound
This procedure was and continued to be the most uncomfortable at each visit. I wouldn’t say it was super painful but depending on pressure, there were some moment where I’d have to breathe deep because it didn’t exactly feel good. During my second IUI cycle my Dr was on vacation and the NP that carried out the ultrasounds was much more comfortable.

### Bloodwork
We both had bloodwork done, testing for disease that may be passed onto children if we happened to both be carriers. I passed with 100%, which is like the second time in my whole life I’ve had a perfect score for anything. Hubby came back with one abnormality but as I wasn’t a carrier for anything we could proceed, in fact since I came back clear there wasn’t really any need for hubs to have to have the tests too so I’m confused why. Maybe just an insurance thing for the clinic?

### HSG
This was a very minor procedure where the doctor was looking for any blockages in my Fallopian tubes. I got undressed from the waist down and waited… actually the doctor had me waiting in the dark room for 20 minutes, which was a little annoying.

The procedure itself was fine; a catheter was inserted through my cervix into my uterus to deliver which I believe was a contrast dye. Light x-ray images were captured showing the fluid passing freely through, that was cool to see. The doctor confirmed that we also passed this element and I’ll talk about why they tested for this in a moment.

### Semen Analysis
The awkward first deposit. Over time hubs would make a few visits ahead of our IUIs but this first time was to check sperm count, mobility, and stuff. Turns out, he has a solid swim team as the doctor and nurses told me no less than three times.

## IUI
So, we had a couple of options to consider. Since I didn’t have any blockages in my Fallopian tubes that might prevent a released egg from meeting with sperm, we were able to try IUI. IUI is far less invasive than IVF and given my age, our genetics and other conditions IUI may be the extra percentage points we need to conceive. There would still be drugs involved but we’re not talking daily shots here.

### My IUI Cycle
_Day 1:_ Email cycle coordinator to schedule baseline ultrasound.

_Day 3:_ Baseline ultrasound – looking for follicles that will be monitored over the next couple of weeks. It was really weird since my periods are really heavy and nobody told me what to really expect. Do I leave my tampon in? What if it makes a mess? To the former, I wish I’d had a little more guidance there, I decided to leave the tampon in, figured they’d tell me to remove it if it was necessary. To the later, I just had to get over that if it got messy, I probably wouldn’t be the first nor the last patient that had that happen and as it turned out, it was a lot of worry over nothing. 

That night I also started my medication. I took 100mg of chlomid for the next 5 days; it helps stimulate follicle growth which I assume is in the hope that we’d get at least one solid egg released at ovulation. The risk here is that you could release multiple which in turn could become a multiple pregnancy which comes with its own set of risks and then there is also hyper stimulation; too many is a bad thing and the cycle will be aborted.

_Day 10:_ About 1 week after your baseline you go back for a follow up ultrasound. This took less than 5 minutes and I had nothing to take away. I was curious, the doctor was measuring something, counting something but I got nothing other than to come back in a few more days. I guess things we’re ready yet.

_Day 13:_ another ultrasound and similar to the previous one, I got little information only the instruction to “trigger tonight”. This I had the MOST anxiety over, how on earth was I going to stick myself with a needle? After being stuck on it for the rest of the day, hubby offered to help if I really couldn’t do it myself but in the end I had a little wine for courage and locked myself in the bathroom with my pre-filled syringe, alcohol wipes, band-aids and an ice cube.

First thing, washed hands and then I picked a spot and held the ice there for a couple of minutes, in the hope that it’d help numb the area (I’d read it can help). Next, I cleaned the chosen area with alcohol wipes and let it air dry and set up my syringe; you have to hold it point up and flick it a few times to get any air to the top and gently press the plunger, way more gently than you think until there is a tiny drop of liquid on the tip of the syringe. That’s it, now you’re ready to administer the shot; I pinched the skin around the numb, cleaned spot and inserted the needle, all the way in and then let go of the pinched skin before pressing the plunger slowly and gently all the way down. Once done, the used syringe went into a sharps container and a bandaid was placed over the injection site. 

That was it, done! I was pretty proud I’d done it myself and now, while I don’t need to watch a needle go into my arm for a blood draw, I can look at it and not be weirded out. Now for the dreaded two week wait.

### The Two Week Wait
I became obsessed with googling every tiny symptom, I also often felt quite spacey and often in the morning I would feel nauseous which I attributed to the elevated hormones now in my body and which went away in a few days. During my second IUI cycle I decided to buy the cheap pregnancy tests that everyone in the forums talks about and “test out the trigger shot”. It cut the wait down by a significant amount of time since I found out by IUI + 10 days that the HGC levels weren’t going to start climbing and that we’d had another unsuccessful month.

## Present Day
We relocated from the west coast to the east coast during the two week wait of my second IUI cycle and so paused treatment while we got settled and found a new doctor. I already have a much better feeling about her – she is kind, informative, and has a much better bedside manner so far. She talked through interesting finding in my medical records from the previous clinic and advised us on next steps. So here we are, 621 days since the first of January 2017, the date we officially said we’d start trying for a baby, still baby-less but optimistic for the future.

* I am by no means a medical professional. I am simply a person, desperately trying to have a family and recounting my sometimes lonely, often sad and angry experience I the hope that it might help someone else going through the same feel less alone.
