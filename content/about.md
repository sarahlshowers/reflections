This whole site is pretty much dedicated to things I enjoy so I invite you to read a few posts and get to know a little about me through that.

I enjoy writing when I do give time to it but then I rarely do, I'm hoping this is first and foremost a platform for me to reflect, reminisce, and regurgitate the things that matter to me. Yes, that's self indulgent but I've mostly put this together for me and if as a bi-product of that I can share something with someone that may help them plan their own trip to a spot I've written about or maybe they've had to wrap their head around some crazy coding convention and I can help try explain in the one millionth different way but maybe that way is the reason the lightbulb moment happens, then that's not a bag thing.
